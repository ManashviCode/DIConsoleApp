### What is Dependency Injection?

Dependency injection (DI) is a design pattern inÂ .NET where dependencies of a class are provided from the outside rather than created within the class itself.
This allows for better modularity, testability, and flexibility by decoupling classes from their dependencies and promoting the use of interfaces or abstractions to define those dependencies.![Presentation1-cc](https://github.com/ManashviCode/DIConsoleApp/assets/123438365/99b95530-ebe5-4db3-915b-0cbfce5fb975)
